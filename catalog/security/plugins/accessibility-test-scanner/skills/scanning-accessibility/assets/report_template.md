`[List the specific pages or sections that were audited.  For example: "Homepage, Contact Us page, Product Listing page, and User Profile section."]`

## Methodology

This audit was conducted using the Accessibility Test Scanner plugin, which performs automated checks based on the following guidelines and standards:

*   **WCAG 2.1/2.2 (Levels A, AA, AAA)**: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
*   **ARIA Validation**: Evaluation of proper ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) usage.
*   **Screen Reader Compatibility**: Simulated screen reader testing.
*   **Keyboard Navigation**: Evaluation of keyboard operability.

`[Optionally, include details about any manual testing performed in addition to the automated checks.]`

## Findings

This section details the accessibility issues identified during the audit.  Each issue is categorized by WCAG success criterion and severity.

**Severity Levels:**

*   **Critical:**  A violation that severely impacts users' ability to access essential content or functionality.
*   **Major:**  A violation that significantly hinders users' ability to access content or functionality.
*   **Moderate:**  A violation that causes some difficulty for users but does not completely prevent access.
*   **Minor:**  A violation that has a minimal impact on users but should still be addressed.

### WCAG 2.1/2.2 Violations

`[For each violation, provide the following information:]`

*   **WCAG Success Criterion:** `[e.g., 1.1.1 Non-text Content, 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)]`
*   **Severity:** `[Critical, Major, Moderate, Minor]`
*   **Description:** `[A clear explanation of the issue.  For example: "The image on the homepage lacks alt text."]`
*   **Location:** `[Specific page or element where the issue was found. For example: "Homepage, <img src="logo.png"> tag."]`
*   **Recommendation:** `[Specific steps to fix the issue.  For example: "Add descriptive alt text to the image.  Example: <img src="logo.png" alt="Company Logo">"]`
*   **Example:**

    **WCAG Success Criterion:** 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)
    **Severity:** Critical
    **Description:** The text color on the call-to-action button does not provide sufficient contrast with the background color, making it difficult for users with low vision to read.
    **Location:** Homepage, `#cta-button`
    **Recommendation:** Increase the contrast ratio between the text and background colors to meet the minimum requirement of 4.5:1 for normal text. Consider using a color contrast checker tool to ensure compliance.
    **Example:** Change the button's background color from `#ddd` to `#007bff` and the text color to `#fff` to meet WCAG contrast requirements.

### ARIA Validation Issues

`[Document any issues related to incorrect or missing ARIA attributes.  Follow the same format as above.]`

*   **Description:** `[e.g., "Missing ARIA label on a form field."]`
*   **Location:** `[e.g., "Contact Us page, <input type="text" id="name">"]`
*   **Recommendation:** `[e.g., "Add aria-label attribute to the input field. Example: <input type="text" id="name" aria-label="Your Name">"]`

### Keyboard Navigation Issues

`[Document any issues related to keyboard accessibility.  Follow the same format as above.]`

*   **Description:** `[e.g., "The tab order is not logical."]`
*   **Location:** `[e.g., "Product Listing page"]`
*   **Recommendation:** `[e.g., "Ensure the tab order follows the visual flow of the page. Use the `tabindex` attribute to explicitly define the tab order if necessary."]`

### Screen Reader Compatibility Issues

`[Document any issues identified during simulated screen reader testing.  Follow the same format as above.]`

*   **Description:** `[e.g., "The screen reader does not announce the state of the checkbox."]`
*   **Location:** `[e.g., "User Profile section, <input type="checkbox" id="newsletter">"]`
*   **Recommendation:** `[e.g., "Use appropriate ARIA attributes to provide screen readers with information about the state of the checkbox. Example: <input type="checkbox" id="newsletter" aria-checked="false">"]`

## Recommendations

`[Provide a summary of the key recommendations for improving the accessibility of the website/application.  Prioritize recommendations based on severity.]`

## Conclusion

`[Summarize the overall accessibility posture of the website/application and outline next steps for remediation.  For example: "While the Accessibility Test Scanner plugin identified several accessibility issues, addressing these issues will significantly improve the user experience for people with disabilities. We recommend prioritizing the critical and major issues and implementing the recommendations outlined in this report."]`
