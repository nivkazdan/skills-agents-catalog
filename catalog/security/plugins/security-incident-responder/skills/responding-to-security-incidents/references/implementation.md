# Implementation Guide

1. Triage the incident and scope affected systems/data.
2. Preserve evidence (logs, snapshots, network captures) before making changes.
3. Contain the blast radius and eradicate root cause.
4. Recover safely and document follow-ups (AAR + backlog).

### 1. Incident Detection and Triage

Classify the security incident:
- Incident type (ransomware, data breach, DDoS, insider threat, phishing)
- Severity level (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Scope assessment (affected systems, data, users)
- Initial timestamp and detection method
- Potential business impact

### 2. Immediate Containment Actions

Prevent further damage:
- Isolate affected systems from network
- Disable compromised user accounts
- Block malicious IP addresses at firewall
- Preserve system state for forensics
- Activate incident response team
- Document all containment actions with timestamps

### 3. Evidence Collection Phase

Gather forensic data systematically:

**System Evidence**:
- Memory dumps from affected systems
- Disk images for forensic analysis
- Running process listings
- Network connection states
- Registry modifications (Windows)

**Log Evidence**:
- Authentication logs (successful/failed logins)
- Application logs with error patterns
- Network traffic logs (firewall, IDS/IPS)
- Database access logs
- Web server access/error logs

**Network Evidence**:
- Packet captures (PCAP files)
- DNS query logs
- Proxy server logs
- Network flow data (NetFlow)

### 4. Investigation and Analysis

Reconstruct the attack timeline:
- Identify initial access vector (how attackers got in)
- Map lateral movement within network
- Determine data exfiltration attempts
- Identify persistence mechanisms
- Assess privilege escalation methods
- Document indicators of compromise (IOCs)

### 5. Eradication Phase

Remove threat from environment:
- Remove malware and backdoors
- Close exploited vulnerabilities
- Reset compromised credentials
- Apply security patches
- Update firewall rules
- Verify threat elimination

### 6. Recovery and Restoration

Restore normal operations:
- Restore systems from clean backups
- Rebuild compromised systems from scratch
- Verify system integrity
- Monitor for reinfection attempts
- Gradually restore services
- Validate business operations

### 7. Post-Incident Documentation

Create comprehensive incident report:
- Executive summary
- Detailed timeline
- Root cause analysis
- Lessons learned
- Remediation recommendations
- Cost impact assessment
