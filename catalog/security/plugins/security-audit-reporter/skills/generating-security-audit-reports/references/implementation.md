# Implementation Guide

1. Collect available security signals (scanner outputs, configs, logs).
2. Analyze findings and map to risk + compliance requirements.
3. Generate a report with prioritized remediation guidance.
4. Format outputs (Markdown/HTML/PDF) and include evidence links.

### 1. Data Collection Phase

Gather security information from available sources:
- Read vulnerability scan results
- Analyze security configurations
- Review access control policies
- Check encryption implementations
- Examine authentication mechanisms

### 2. Analysis Phase

Process collected data to identify:
- Critical vulnerabilities (CVSS scores, exploitability)
- Security misconfigurations
- Compliance gaps against standards (PCI-DSS, GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2)
- Access control weaknesses
- Data protection issues

### 3. Report Generation Phase

Create structured audit report with:
- Executive summary with risk overview
- Detailed vulnerability findings with severity ratings
- Compliance status matrix
- Risk assessment and prioritization
- Remediation recommendations with timelines
- Technical appendices with evidence

### 4. Output Formatting

Generate report in requested format:
- Markdown for version control
- HTML for stakeholder review
- JSON for integration with ticketing systems
- PDF-ready structure for formal documentation
