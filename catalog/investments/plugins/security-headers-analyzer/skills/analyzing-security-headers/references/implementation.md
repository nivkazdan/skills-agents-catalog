# Implementation Guide

1. Collect the target URL/domain and environment context (CDN/proxy, redirects).
2. Fetch response headers (HTTP/HTTPS) and capture redirects/cookies.
3. Compare headers to recommended baselines and score gaps.
4. Provide concrete remediation steps and verify fixes.

### 1. Domain Input Phase

Accept domain specification:
- Full URL with protocol (https://example.com)
- Domain name only (example.com - will test HTTPS first)
- Multiple domains for batch analysis
- Specific paths for header variation testing

### 2. Header Fetching Phase

Retrieve HTTP response headers:
- Make HEAD or GET request to target
- Capture all security-relevant headers
- Test both HTTP and HTTPS responses
- Record redirect chains and final destination

### 3. Analysis Phase

Evaluate each security header against best practices:

**Critical Headers**:
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
- Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- Permissions-Policy

**Important Headers**:
- Referrer-Policy
- Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy (COEP)
- Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP)
- Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy (CORP)

**Additional Checks**:
- Server header information disclosure
- X-Powered-By header exposure
- Cookie security attributes (Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite)

### 4. Grading Phase

Calculate security score:
- A+ (95-100): All critical headers properly configured
- A (85-94): Critical headers present, minor issues
- B (75-84): Most headers present, some weaknesses
- C (65-74): Missing critical headers
- D (50-64): Significant security gaps
- F (<50): Multiple critical vulnerabilities

### 5. Report Generation Phase

Create comprehensive report with:
- Overall security grade and numeric score
- Missing headers with impact assessment
- Misconfigured headers with specific issues
- Remediation recommendations with examples
- Priority ranking for fixes
