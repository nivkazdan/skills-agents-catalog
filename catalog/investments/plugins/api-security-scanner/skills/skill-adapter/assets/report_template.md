## Vulnerability Details

This section provides detailed information about each vulnerability identified during the scan, including its severity, description, and recommended remediation steps.

### 1. [Vulnerability Title, e.g., Broken Authentication]

*   **OWASP API Security Top 10 Category:** [e.g., API1:2023 Broken Object Level Authorization]
*   **Severity:** [e.g., High, Medium, Low, Informational]
*   **Description:** [Provide a detailed explanation of the vulnerability.  For example: `The API endpoint is vulnerable to Broken Authentication due to weak password policies and the absence of multi-factor authentication. Attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to user accounts by brute-forcing passwords.`]
*   **Affected Endpoint(s):** [List the specific API endpoints affected by the vulnerability.  For example: `/api/login`, `/api/reset-password`]
*   **Request Example:**

    ```
    POST /api/login
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "username": "testuser",
      "password": "weakpassword"
    }
    ```
*   **Response Example:**

    ```
    {
      "status": "success",
      "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
    }
    ```
*   **Impact:** [Describe the potential impact of the vulnerability. For example: `Successful exploitation could allow attackers to access sensitive user data, perform actions on behalf of users, and potentially compromise the entire system.`]
*   **Recommendation:** [Provide specific and actionable remediation steps. For example: `Implement strong password policies, enforce multi-factor authentication, and implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.`]
*   **Evidence:** [Provide evidence or proof of concept that demonstrates the vulnerability. This could include screenshots, logs, or code snippets.  Be mindful of sensitive information.]

### 2. [Vulnerability Title, e.g., Injection Vulnerability]

*   **OWASP API Security Top 10 Category:** [e.g., API2:2023 Broken User Authentication]
*   **Severity:** [e.g., High, Medium, Low, Informational]
*   **Description:** [Provide a detailed explanation of the vulnerability. For example: `The API endpoint is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input validation. Attackers can potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries by injecting malicious code into input fields.`]
*   **Affected Endpoint(s):** [List the specific API endpoints affected by the vulnerability. For example: `/api/users/{id}`]
*   **Request Example:**

    ```
    GET /api/users/1' OR '1'='1
    ```
*   **Response Example:** [Show the unexpected response indicating injection success, or an error message revealing the backend technology.]
*   **Impact:** [Describe the potential impact of the vulnerability. For example: `Successful exploitation could allow attackers to access, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database, potentially leading to data breaches and system compromise.`]
*   **Recommendation:** [Provide specific and actionable remediation steps. For example: `Implement proper input validation, use parameterized queries or prepared statements, and apply the principle of least privilege to database access.`]
*   **Evidence:** [Provide evidence or proof of concept that demonstrates the vulnerability. This could include screenshots, logs, or code snippets. Be mindful of sensitive information.]

### 3. [Vulnerability Title, e.g., Excessive Data Exposure]

*   **OWASP API Security Top 10 Category:** [e.g., API3:2023 Excessive Data Exposure]
*   **Severity:** [e.g., High, Medium, Low, Informational]
*   **Description:** [Provide a detailed explanation of the vulnerability. For example: `The API endpoint returns more data than necessary, potentially exposing sensitive user information to unauthorized parties.`]
*   **Affected Endpoint(s):** [List the specific API endpoints affected by the vulnerability. For example: `/api/profile`]
*   **Request Example:**

    ```
    GET /api/profile
    ```
*   **Response Example:**

    ```json
    {
      "id": 123,
      "username": "testuser",
      "email": "testuser@example.com",
      "phone_number": "555-123-4567",
      "address": "123 Main St",
      "credit_card_number": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    }
    ```
*   **Impact:** [Describe the potential impact of the vulnerability. For example: `Exposure of sensitive data could lead to identity theft, financial fraud, and privacy violations.`]
*   **Recommendation:** [Provide specific and actionable remediation steps. For example: `Implement data filtering and masking to return only the necessary data to the client. Avoid exposing sensitive information such as credit card numbers and social security numbers.`]
*   **Evidence:** [Provide evidence or proof of concept that demonstrates the vulnerability. This could include screenshots, logs, or code snippets. Be mindful of sensitive information.]
