## Key Derivatives Concepts

### Funding Rates
- **Positive funding**: Longs pay shorts (bullish sentiment)
- **Negative funding**: Shorts pay longs (bearish sentiment)
- **Extreme rates**: Contrarian opportunity (often >0.1% 8-hour)
- **Funding arbitrage**: Long spot + short perp when funding is high

### Open Interest
- **Rising OI + rising price**: Strong bullish trend
- **Rising OI + falling price**: Strong bearish trend
- **Falling OI + rising price**: Short covering
- **Falling OI + falling price**: Long liquidations

### Futures Basis
- **Contango (positive basis)**: Futures > spot (normal market)
- **Backwardation (negative basis)**: Futures < spot (high demand for spot)
- **Cash-and-carry**: Buy spot + sell futures (earn basis)
- **Reverse cash-and-carry**: Sell spot + buy futures

### Options Greeks
- **Delta**: Price sensitivity to underlying
- **Gamma**: Rate of delta change
- **Vega**: Sensitivity to volatility changes
- **Theta**: Time decay
- **Rho**: Interest rate sensitivity (less relevant in crypto)

### Implied Volatility
- **High IV**: Options expensive, expect big moves
- **Low IV**: Options cheap, complacency
- **IV Rank**: Percentile of IV over past year
- **Volatility smile**: IV varies by strike (skew indicates sentiment)

## Trading Strategies

### 1. Funding Rate Arbitrage
```
When: Funding > 0.1% (8-hour) or < -0.05%
Strategy:
- Long spot + Short perpetual (positive funding)
- Short spot + Long perpetual (negative funding)
Risk: Basis risk, exchange risk
```

### 2. Basis Trading (Cash-and-Carry)
```
When: Quarterly basis > 5% annualized
Strategy: Buy spot + Sell quarterly futures
Hold until expiry or basis converges
Risk: Margin requirements, early liquidation
```

### 3. Liquidation Hunting
```
When: Large liquidation clusters identified
Strategy: Enter positions targeting liquidation cascades
Risk: False breakouts, slippage
```

### 4. Options Volatility Trading
```
When: IV rank < 20 (cheap vol) or > 80 (expensive vol)
Strategy:
- Buy straddles/strangles when IV low
- Sell spreads when IV high
Risk: Gamma risk, large moves
```

### 5. Put/Call Dispersion
```
When: Unusual options flow detected
Strategy: Follow smart money positioning
Risk: Misinterpretation, manipulation
```

## Risk Management

### Position Sizing
- Derivatives are leveraged - use smaller positions
- Account for funding costs in perps
- Consider theta decay in options
- Monitor liquidation prices continuously

### Exchange Risk
- Counterparty risk on CEXes
- Smart contract risk on DEXes
- Spread positions across exchanges
- Keep most funds in cold storage

### Market Risk
- Volatile funding can erode profits
- Basis can widen before converging
- Liquidation cascades can gap prices
- Options can expire worthless
