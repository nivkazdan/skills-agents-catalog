# Best Practices Applied

## Best Practices Applied

### Security
✅ IAM least privilege service accounts
✅ VPC Service Controls for enterprise isolation
✅ Model Armor for prompt injection protection
✅ Encrypted data at rest and in transit
✅ No hardcoded credentials (use Secret Manager)

### Performance
✅ Auto-scaling configuration (min/max instances)
✅ Appropriate machine types and accelerators
✅ Caching strategies for repeated queries
✅ Batch processing for high throughput
✅ Token optimization for cost efficiency

### Observability
✅ Cloud Monitoring dashboards
✅ Alerting policies for errors and latency
✅ Structured logging with severity levels
✅ Distributed tracing with Cloud Trace
✅ Error tracking with Cloud Error Reporting

### Reliability
✅ Multi-region deployment for high availability
✅ Circuit breaker patterns for fault tolerance
✅ Retry logic with exponential backoff
✅ Health check endpoints
✅ Graceful degradation strategies

### Cost Optimization
✅ Use Gemini 2.5 Flash for simple tasks (cheaper)
✅ Gemini 2.5 Pro for complex reasoning (higher quality)
✅ Batch predictions for bulk processing
✅ Preemptible instances for non-critical workloads
✅ Token counting to estimate costs
