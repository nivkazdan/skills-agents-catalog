## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Set up performance monitoring and distributed tracing with Sentry for tracking application performance and request flows across services.
**Workflow:** Enable after basic error tracking is working. Configure sample rates, create transactions and spans, and set up distributed tracing.
**Relates to:** Builds on `sentry-error-capture` context. Works with `sentry-performance-tuning` for optimization.

## Summary

This skill sets up performance monitoring and distributed tracing to track application performance metrics. It covers enabling performance monitoring, creating transactions and spans, distributed tracing headers, sample rate guidelines, and custom instrumentation. Use this skill when you need APM capabilities beyond error tracking to identify performance bottlenecks.
