## Summary

This skill implements observability for Replit applications. It covers structured logging with proper log levels, integrating external logging services (Logtail, Papertrail, Datadog), collecting application metrics and custom instrumentation, setting up external uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot, Better Stack), configuring alerting for errors and performance degradation, implementing distributed tracing for complex applications, creating dashboards for key performance indicators, and debugging production issues using observability data. Observability is essential for operating reliable production services.
