## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Optimize Replit application performance with caching, lazy loading, and resource optimization strategies.
**Workflow:** Performance optimization skill - improves user experience and resource efficiency.
**Relates to:** Complements replit-resource-limits; informs replit-cost-optimization.

## Summary

This skill optimizes Replit application performance. It covers implementing in-memory and disk-based caching, lazy loading modules and assets to reduce startup time, optimizing database queries and connection pooling, reducing memory footprint through efficient data structures, profiling code to identify bottlenecks, implementing async/await patterns for I/O operations, optimizing frontend bundle sizes for web apps, and configuring CDN caching for static assets. Performance optimization improves user experience while reducing resource costs.
