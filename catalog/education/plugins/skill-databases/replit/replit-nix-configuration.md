**Purpose:** Configure Nix packages and system dependencies for reproducible Replit environments.
**Workflow:** Environment configuration skill - enables advanced system-level customization.
**Relates to:** Required for replit-common-errors resolution; foundation for complex projects.

## Summary

This skill covers Nix configuration for Replit environments. It teaches editing the replit.nix file to add system packages, installing language runtimes and tools (Python, Node, Rust, Go), adding system libraries for native dependencies (OpenSSL, libpq), configuring shell hooks for environment setup, understanding Nix channels and package versions, troubleshooting Nix build failures, and creating reproducible environments that work identically for all team members. Nix provides the foundation for Replit's reproducible development environments.
