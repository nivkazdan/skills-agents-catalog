## Summary

This skill covers Replit's GraphQL API for programmatic platform control. It teaches authenticating with API tokens for programmatic access, querying Repl metadata and status via GraphQL, creating and deleting Repls programmatically, triggering deployments from external CI/CD systems, managing team members and permissions via API, integrating Replit into existing automation workflows, building custom dashboards and monitoring tools, rate limiting and API best practices, and using the API for bulk operations across many Repls. API integration enables advanced automation and tooling.
