## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Implement testing workflows with unit tests, integration tests, and automated test runs on Replit.
**Workflow:** Quality assurance skill - establishes testing practices for reliable code.
**Relates to:** Complements replit-github-integration; informs replit-deployments pre-flight checks.

## Summary

This skill implements testing workflows within Replit. It covers setting up testing frameworks (pytest, Jest, unittest), writing unit tests for individual functions, creating integration tests for API endpoints, configuring automatic test runs on file save, generating test coverage reports, integrating tests with GitHub PR workflows, using Replit's console for test debugging, and implementing test-driven development (TDD) practices. Automated testing ensures code quality and prevents regressions.
