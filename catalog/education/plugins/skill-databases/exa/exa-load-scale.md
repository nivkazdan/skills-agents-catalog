## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Implement load testing, auto-scaling strategies, and capacity planning for Exa search workloads.
**Workflow:** Capacity planning skill - ensures Exa integration handles production traffic.
**Relates to:** Follows exa-performance-tuning; informs exa-cost-tuning

## Summary

This skill covers load testing and scaling: k6/Artillery load test scripts for Exa endpoints, performance baseline establishment, scaling thresholds and triggers, capacity planning based on traffic patterns, traffic spike handling strategies, auto-scaling configuration for search services, performance degradation monitoring, cost modeling at different scales, and benchmark documentation for planning. Target: Handle 10x traffic surge with <20% latency degradation.
