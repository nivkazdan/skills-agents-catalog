### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Master Exa's three search modes - neural (semantic), keyword (exact match), and auto (intelligent selection) - with appropriate use cases for each.
**Workflow:** Core learning skill after hello-world - understanding search modes is fundamental to effective Exa usage.
**Relates to:** Follows exa-hello-world; foundational for exa-filters-domains and exa-performance-tuning

## Summary

This skill teaches the three Exa search modes: neural (semantic understanding, best for natural language queries), keyword (exact matching, best for specific terms), and auto (intelligent mode selection). It includes decision logic for when to use each mode, example queries demonstrating each mode's strengths, and patterns for building adaptive search that selects the optimal mode based on query characteristics.
