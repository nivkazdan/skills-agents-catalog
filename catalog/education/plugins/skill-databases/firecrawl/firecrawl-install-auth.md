## Summary

This skill handles the initial setup of FireCrawl SDK authentication. It guides developers through installing the appropriate SDK package (npm or pip), configuring API keys via environment variables or .env files, and verifying the connection works correctly. This is the essential first step before any web scraping can begin. FireCrawl provides both JavaScript/TypeScript and Python SDKs for flexible integration.
