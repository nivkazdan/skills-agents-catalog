## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Optimize FireCrawl costs through caching, request deduplication, usage monitoring, and budget alerts.
**Workflow:** FinOps skill - reduces API costs while maintaining scraping effectiveness.
**Relates to:** Complements firecrawl-local-dev-loop for development costs; supports firecrawl-batch-processing efficiency

## Summary

This skill optimizes FireCrawl API costs through multiple strategies. It covers implementing response caching to avoid redundant scrapes, URL deduplication to prevent duplicate requests, choosing appropriate scrape options (avoiding expensive features when unnecessary), usage monitoring and alerting, and budget controls to prevent cost overruns. These techniques can reduce API costs by 50% or more while maintaining data quality.
