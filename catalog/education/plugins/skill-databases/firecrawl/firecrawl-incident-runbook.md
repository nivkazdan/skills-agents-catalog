## Summary

This skill provides incident response procedures for FireCrawl scraping pipeline failures. It covers incident classification (P1-P4), initial triage steps, common failure scenarios (API outage, rate limiting, blocked requests, target site changes), mitigation actions, stakeholder communication templates, and post-incident review procedures. This enables rapid, consistent response to production scraping incidents.
