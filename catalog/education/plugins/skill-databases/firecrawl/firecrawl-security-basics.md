**Purpose:** Apply security best practices for API key management, proxy configuration, request headers, and stealth scraping techniques.
**Workflow:** Security hardening skill - establishes secure patterns for production scraping operations.
**Relates to:** Builds on firecrawl-install-auth; extends into firecrawl-enterprise-rbac for team scenarios

## Summary

This skill implements security best practices for FireCrawl operations. It covers secure API key storage (environment variables, secrets managers, never in code), proxy rotation for distributed scraping, custom request headers for stealth, user agent rotation, and audit logging for compliance. These patterns protect both your infrastructure and ensure responsible, undetectable scraping operations.
