## Summary

This skill provides a comprehensive production deployment checklist for FireCrawl scraping pipelines. It covers pre-flight verification (API connectivity, credential validation, test scrapes), monitoring setup (success rates, latency, error tracking), error handling verification (retry logic, fallbacks, alerting), rate limit configuration, and rollback procedures. Following this checklist ensures scraping pipelines are production-ready with proper observability and failure handling.
