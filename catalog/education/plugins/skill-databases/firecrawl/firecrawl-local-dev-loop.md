## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Configure FireCrawl local development with testing, caching, and fast iteration cycles to minimize API costs during development.
**Workflow:** Development environment setup skill - establishes efficient local development patterns before production scraping.
**Relates to:** Follows firecrawl-hello-world; complements firecrawl-cost-tuning for cost optimization

## Summary

This skill configures an efficient local development environment for FireCrawl. It implements response caching to avoid repeated API calls for the same URLs during development, sets up test fixtures with saved responses, and configures environment variable management. The goal is to enable rapid iteration without incurring unnecessary API costs while developing scraping logic.
