## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Choose and implement Supabase validated architecture blueprints: Monolith (simple), Service Layer (moderate), and Microservice (complex) with migration paths.
**Workflow:** Architecture decision skill. Used when designing new integrations or planning scaling.
**Relates to:** Builds on supabase-reference-architecture; informs supabase-known-pitfalls for architecture-specific issues.

## Summary

This skill provides three validated architecture blueprints for Supabase integrations at different scales. It covers Monolith pattern for MVPs and small teams, Service Layer pattern for growing startups, Microservice pattern for enterprise scale, decision matrix based on team size and DAU, and migration paths between variants. Use this skill when designing new Supabase integrations or planning migration paths for future scaling.
