## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Optimize Supabase API performance with caching (LRU and Redis), request batching with DataLoader, connection pooling, and pagination optimization.
**Workflow:** Performance optimization skill. Used when experiencing slow API responses or high latency.
**Relates to:** Complements supabase-sdk-patterns with performance patterns; leads to supabase-cost-tuning.

## Summary

This skill provides advanced performance optimization techniques for Supabase integrations. It covers latency benchmarks, response caching strategies (in-memory and Redis), request batching with DataLoader, connection pooling optimization, pagination with async generators, and performance monitoring. Use this skill when experiencing slow API responses or when optimizing for high-throughput scenarios.
