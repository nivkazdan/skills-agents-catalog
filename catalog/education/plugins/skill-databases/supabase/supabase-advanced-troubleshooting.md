## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Apply Supabase advanced debugging techniques for hard-to-diagnose issues including layer-by-layer isolation, timing analysis, memory profiling, and race condition detection.
**Workflow:** First advanced skill. Used when standard troubleshooting fails.
**Relates to:** Escalation from supabase-debug-bundle; informs supabase-load-scale for performance issues.

## Summary

This skill provides deep debugging techniques for complex Supabase issues. It covers comprehensive debug bundle collection, systematic layer-by-layer isolation testing, minimal reproduction creation, timing analysis with performance profiling, memory leak detection, race condition detection, and support escalation templates. Use this skill when standard troubleshooting fails or when investigating intermittent or complex issues.
