## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Implement Supabase load testing with k6, horizontal auto-scaling with Kubernetes HPA, connection pooling, and capacity planning.
**Workflow:** Performance testing skill. Used for validating performance and planning capacity.
**Relates to:** Builds on supabase-performance-tuning; informs supabase-reliability-patterns for production hardening.

## Summary

This skill provides comprehensive load testing and scaling guidance for Supabase integrations. It covers k6 load test scripts with thresholds, Kubernetes HPA configuration, connection pooling with generic-pool, capacity planning metrics and calculations, and benchmark results documentation templates. Use this skill when running performance tests, configuring horizontal scaling, or planning capacity for Supabase integrations.
