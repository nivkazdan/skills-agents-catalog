## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Implement Supabase reference architecture with best-practice project layout, layered architecture, client wrapper, error boundary, and health checks.
**Workflow:** Architecture skill. Used when designing new Supabase integrations or reviewing project structure.
**Relates to:** Foundational for supabase-multi-env-setup; informs supabase-architecture-variants decisions.

## Summary

This skill provides a production-ready reference architecture for Supabase integrations. It covers project structure with supabase/, services/, api/, and jobs/ directories, layered architecture diagram, client wrapper with caching and monitoring, error boundary implementation, data flow patterns, and configuration management. Use this skill when designing new Supabase integrations or establishing architecture standards.
