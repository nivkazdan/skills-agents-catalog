## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Apply production-ready Supabase SDK patterns including singleton client, error handling wrapper, retry logic with exponential backoff, and Zod validation.
**Workflow:** Fourth skill in onboarding. Establishes the patterns that will be used throughout the codebase for all Supabase operations.
**Relates to:** Builds on supabase-local-dev-loop; patterns used by all subsequent operational skills.

## Summary

This skill provides production-ready patterns for Supabase SDK usage in TypeScript and Python. It covers singleton pattern for client instantiation, safe error handling wrappers, retry logic with exponential backoff, factory pattern for multi-tenant scenarios, and runtime validation with Zod. Use this skill when establishing coding standards for your team or refactoring existing Supabase code to follow best practices.
