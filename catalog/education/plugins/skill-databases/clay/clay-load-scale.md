## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Implement Clay load testing, bulk processing, and capacity planning strategies. Validates performance at scale and enables high-volume enrichment.
**Workflow:** Performance engineering skill. Use when scaling Clay operations.
**Relates to:** Builds on clay-performance-tuning; informs clay-cost-tuning for volume pricing.

## Summary

This skill implements load testing and scaling for Clay integrations. It covers creating load test scripts for enrichment operations, configuring bulk processing pipelines, benchmarking throughput and latency, capacity planning based on business projections, implementing queue-based processing for large datasets, and optimizing for high-volume scenarios. Target: validate performance at 10x current volume.
