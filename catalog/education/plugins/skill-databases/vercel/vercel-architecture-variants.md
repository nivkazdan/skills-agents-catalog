## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Choose and implement validated architecture blueprints for monolith, service layer, or microservice scales.
**Workflow:** Used during initial project planning and when evaluating architecture evolution.
**Relates to:** Follows vercel-policy-guardrails; leads to vercel-known-pitfalls for anti-patterns

## Summary

This skill provides three validated architecture blueprints for different scales. Variant A (Monolith) suits MVPs and small teams with <10K DAU. Variant B (Service Layer) suits growing startups with 10K-100K DAU. Variant C (Microservice) suits enterprise with 100K+ DAU. Each variant includes project structure, key characteristics, code patterns, and migration paths to the next level. The decision matrix helps choose based on team size, DAU, deployment frequency, and failure isolation needs.
