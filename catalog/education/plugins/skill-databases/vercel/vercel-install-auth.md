## Summary

This skill handles the initial setup of Vercel SDK and CLI authentication. It guides developers through installing the appropriate SDK package (npm or pip), configuring API keys via environment variables or .env files, and verifying the connection works correctly. This is the essential first step before any Vercel development can begin.
