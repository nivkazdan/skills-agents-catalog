## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Optimizes context window usage in Cursor for better AI responses, covering context sources, optimization strategies, and conversation management.

**Workflow:** This skill activates when users want to improve AI response quality or are hitting context limits. It covers understanding context, sources (automatic and manual), optimization strategies, conversation management, and advanced techniques.

**Relates to:** cursor-ai-chat (context in chat), cursor-codebase-indexing (indexed context), cursor-model-selection (context limits per model), cursor-custom-prompts (efficient prompts)

## Summary

This optimization skill focuses on effective context window management in Cursor. It explains what context is (selected code, open files, @-mentions, history, .cursorrules), model context limits (GPT-4 Turbo 128K, Claude 200K), context sources (automatic and @-mentions), optimization strategies (prioritize relevant code, minimize waste, efficient prompts), managing large codebases, conversation management (when to start new chat, preserving context), and advanced techniques (layered context, context priming).
