## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Establishes reference architecture patterns for Cursor IDE projects including folder structures, configuration files, workflow architecture, and documentation standards.

**Workflow:** This skill activates when setting up new projects or standardizing team architecture. It covers project structure patterns, configuration file architecture, team configuration, workflow patterns, monorepo architecture, security, and documentation.

**Relates to:** cursor-team-setup (team configuration), cursor-rules-config (.cursorrules templates), cursor-multi-repo (monorepo patterns), cursor-prod-checklist (production setup)

## Summary

This architectural skill provides reference patterns for Cursor-optimized projects. It covers project structure patterns (feature-based and layer-based architecture), essential Cursor files (.cursorrules, .cursorignore, .vscode/), comprehensive .cursorrules template with all sections, shared team settings, workflow architecture (plan, scaffold, implement, refine, review, test), CI/CD integration, monorepo architecture with Turborepo, security architecture (.cursorignore for sensitive files), and AI-friendly documentation patterns.
