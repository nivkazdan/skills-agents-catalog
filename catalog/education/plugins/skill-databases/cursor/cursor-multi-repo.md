## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Enables working with multiple repositories in Cursor including workspace configurations, monorepo patterns, and cross-project operations.

**Workflow:** This skill activates when developers work across multiple repositories or within monorepos. It covers strategy options, single repo per window, multi-root workspaces, monorepo patterns, indexing, cross-project operations, and troubleshooting.

**Relates to:** cursor-codebase-indexing (indexing multiple repos), cursor-reference-architecture (monorepo architecture), cursor-rules-config (workspace-level rules), cursor-context-management (cross-repo context)

## Summary

This workflow skill covers multi-repository development in Cursor. It includes strategy options (single repo per window, multi-root workspace, monorepo), single repo per window (when to use, cross-repo workflow), multi-root workspace configuration (workspace files, root .cursorrules, per-project overrides, cross-project context), monorepo patterns (Turborepo/Nx structure, workspace .cursorrules), indexing strategy (selective indexing, per-project), cross-project operations (shared type updates, API contract changes, dependency updates), best practices, and troubleshooting.
