# Synthetic Monitoring Setup

Implement proactive synthetic monitoring to track performance and availability.

## Monitoring Types

1. **Uptime Monitoring**: Endpoint availability checks
2. **Transaction Monitoring**: Critical user journey simulation
3. **API Monitoring**: Endpoint response time and correctness
4. **Multi-location Testing**: Geographic performance variation
5. **SSL Certificate Monitoring**: Certificate expiration tracking

## Process

1. Identify critical endpoints and user journeys
2. Design monitoring scenarios
3. Configure monitoring tools (Pingdom, Datadog Synthetics, etc.)
4. Set up multi-location testing
5. Define alert thresholds
6. Create response playbooks

## Output

Provide:
- Monitoring configuration for chosen platform
- Test scripts for critical transactions
- Multi-location test setup
- Alert rule definitions
- Dashboard configuration
- Incident response procedures
- Integration with existing monitoring stack
