# Auto-Scaling Configuration Template

# --- Global Settings ---
global:
  # Enable or disable auto-scaling globally
  enabled: true

  # Default cooldown period (in seconds) after a scaling event
  cooldown: 300 # seconds (5 minutes)

application:
  name: REPLACE_ME # Application Name (e.g., web-app, api-server)
  type: web  # Application type (e.g., web, api, worker)

  # Resource limits (CPU, Memory)
  resources:
    cpu:
      min: 0.5  # Minimum CPU units
      max: 4    # Maximum CPU units
    memory:
      min: 512  # Minimum memory in MB
      max: 4096 # Maximum memory in MB

# --- Scaling Policies ---
scaling_policies:
  # --- CPU Utilization Scaling ---
  cpu_utilization:
    enabled: true
    target_utilization: 70 # Target CPU utilization percentage
    scale_up_threshold: 80  # CPU usage percentage to trigger scale-up
    scale_down_threshold: 40 # CPU usage percentage to trigger scale-down
    scale_up_increment: 1    # Number of instances to add during scale-up
    scale_down_decrement: 1  # Number of instances to remove during scale-down

  # --- Memory Utilization Scaling ---
  memory_utilization:
    enabled: true
    target_utilization: 75 # Target Memory utilization percentage

    scale_up_increment: 1    # Number of instances to add during scale-up
    scale_down_decrement: 1  # Number of instances to remove during scale-down

  # --- Request Latency Scaling ---
  request_latency:
    enabled: false # Enable only if latency metrics are available
    target_latency: 200 # Target request latency in milliseconds
    scale_up_threshold: 500 # Latency in milliseconds to trigger scale-up
    scale_down_threshold: 100 # Latency in milliseconds to trigger scale-down
    scale_up_increment: 1    # Number of instances to add during scale-up
    scale_down_decrement: 1  # Number of instances to remove during scale-down

  # --- Custom Metric Scaling ---
  custom_metric:
    enabled: false # Enable only if a custom metric is available
    metric_name: YOUR_VALUE_HERE # Name of the custom metric
    target_value: YOUR_VALUE_HERE # Target value for the custom metric
    scale_up_threshold: YOUR_VALUE_HERE # Threshold to trigger scale-up
    scale_down_threshold: YOUR_VALUE_HERE # Threshold to trigger scale-down
    scale_up_increment: 1    # Number of instances to add during scale-up
    scale_down_decrement: 1  # Number of instances to remove during scale-down

# --- Infrastructure Configuration ---
infrastructure:
  platform: aws # Cloud platform (e.g., aws, azure, gcp, on-prem)
  region: us-east-1 # Cloud region
  instance_type: t3.medium # Instance type for new instances
  min_instances: 1    # Minimum number of instances
  max_instances: 5    # Maximum number of instances

# --- Monitoring Configuration ---
monitoring:
  # Integration with monitoring tools (e.g., CloudWatch, Prometheus)
  # Configure details for your monitoring system here
  # Example:
  type: cloudwatch # Monitoring system type
  namespace: MyApp # Monitoring namespace
  metric_prefix: MyAppInstance # Metric prefix
