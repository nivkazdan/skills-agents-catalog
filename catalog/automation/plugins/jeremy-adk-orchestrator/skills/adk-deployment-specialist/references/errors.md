# Error Handling Reference

- Deployment failures: provide the exact failing command, logs to inspect, and the minimal change to unblock
- Auth/permission issues: identify the missing role/API and suggest least-privilege remediation
- Orchestration failures: isolate which agent step failed and provide a retry-safe plan
