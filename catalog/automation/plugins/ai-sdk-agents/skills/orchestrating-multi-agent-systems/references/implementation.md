# Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Initialize Project Structure
Set up the foundation for your multi-agent system:
1. Create project directory with necessary subdirectories
2. Initialize npm project with TypeScript configuration
3. Install AI SDK v5 and provider-specific packages
4. Set up configuration files for agent orchestration

### Step 2: Define Agent Roles
Identify and specify specialized agents needed:
- Determine agent responsibilities and capabilities
- Define agent system prompts with clear instructions
- Specify tools each agent can access
- Establish agent communication protocols

### Step 3: Implement Agents
Create individual agent files with proper configuration:
1. Write agent initialization code with AI SDK
2. Configure system prompts for agent behavior
3. Define tool functions for agent capabilities
4. Implement handoff rules for inter-agent delegation

### Step 4: Configure Orchestration
Set up coordination between agents:
- Define workflow sequences for task processing
- Implement routing logic for task distribution
- Configure handoff mechanisms between agents
- Set up state management for multi-step workflows

### Step 5: Test and Refine
Validate the multi-agent system functionality:
- Test individual agent responses and behaviors
- Verify handoff execution between agents
- Validate routing logic with different input scenarios
- Monitor coordination and identify bottlenecks
