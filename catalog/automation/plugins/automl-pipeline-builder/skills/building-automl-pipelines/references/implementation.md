# Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Define Pipeline Requirements
Specify the machine learning task and constraints:
1. Identify problem type (binary/multi-class classification, regression, etc.)
2. Define evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1, RMSE, etc.)
3. Set time and resource budgets for AutoML search
4. Specify feature types and preprocessing needs
5. Determine model interpretability requirements

### Step 2: Prepare Data Infrastructure
Set up data access and preprocessing:
1. Load training data using Read tool
2. Perform initial data quality assessment
3. Configure train/validation/test split strategy
4. Define feature engineering transformations
5. Set up data validation checks

### Step 3: Configure AutoML Pipeline
Build the automated pipeline configuration:
- Select AutoML framework based on requirements
- Define search space for algorithms (random forest, XGBoost, neural networks, etc.)
- Configure feature preprocessing steps (scaling, encoding, imputation)
- Set hyperparameter tuning strategy (Bayesian optimization, random search, grid search)
- Establish early stopping criteria and timeout limits

### Step 4: Execute Pipeline Training
Run the automated training process:
1. Initialize AutoML pipeline with configuration
2. Execute automated feature engineering
3. Perform model selection across algorithm families
4. Conduct hyperparameter optimization for top models
5. Evaluate models using cross-validation

### Step 5: Analyze and Export Results
Evaluate pipeline performance and prepare for deployment:
- Compare model performances across metrics
- Extract best model and configuration
- Generate feature importance analysis
- Create model performance visualizations
- Export trained pipeline for deployment
