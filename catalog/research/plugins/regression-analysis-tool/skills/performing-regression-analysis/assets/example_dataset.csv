# Example dataset for regression analysis with the regression-analysis-tool plugin.
# This dataset contains independent variables (X1, X2, X3) and a dependent variable (Y).
# Use this dataset as a starting point for running the /run-regression command.
# You can replace this data with your own dataset. Ensure your data is clean and properly formatted.
# Columns should be comma-separated.  The first row should be the header row.
# If you need to include text values, enclose them in double quotes.
# This example contains 10 rows, but your dataset can contain more.
