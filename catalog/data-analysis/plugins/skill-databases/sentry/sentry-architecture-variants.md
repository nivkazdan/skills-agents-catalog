## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Sentry architecture patterns for different application types including monoliths, microservices, serverless, hybrid, event-driven, and multi-tenant architectures.
**Workflow:** Reference when designing Sentry integration for specific application architectures. Provides patterns appropriate for each type.
**Relates to:** Works with `sentry-reference-architecture` for overall design. Connects to `sentry-multi-env-setup` for environments.

## Summary

This skill provides architecture patterns for integrating Sentry with different application types. It covers monolith architecture with module tagging, microservices with project-per-service, serverless with AWS Lambda, GCP Functions, and Vercel, hybrid architectures, event-driven with message queue integration, multi-tenant architecture, edge/CDN monitoring, and an architecture decision guide. Use this skill when designing for specific application types.
