## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Optimize Sentry performance monitoring configuration including dynamic sampling, SDK overhead reduction, and transaction optimization.
**Workflow:** Apply after initial performance monitoring setup. Fine-tunes configuration for production workloads and cost optimization.
**Relates to:** Builds on `sentry-performance-tracing`. Works with `sentry-cost-tuning` for cost management.

## Summary

This skill optimizes Sentry performance monitoring for production workloads. It covers dynamic sampling based on transaction type, environment-based sample rates, reducing SDK overhead, minimal integrations, transaction optimization with meaningful names, profile sampling, and performance benchmarking. Use this skill when you need to balance performance monitoring quality with overhead and cost.
