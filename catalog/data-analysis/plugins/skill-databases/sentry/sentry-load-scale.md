### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Scale Sentry for high-traffic applications handling millions of events with adaptive sampling, buffering, resource optimization, and quota management.
**Workflow:** Apply when scaling applications or experiencing high event volumes. Optimizes Sentry for cost-effective high-volume operation.
**Relates to:** Works with `sentry-cost-tuning` for cost management. Connects to `sentry-rate-limits` for quota control.

## Summary

This skill optimizes Sentry for high-traffic applications handling millions of events. It covers high-volume sampling strategies including adaptive and tiered sampling, client-side buffering and batching, resource optimization, async event processing, multi-region deployment, quota management at scale, budget allocation, dynamic rate adjustment, and Sentry health monitoring. Use this skill for large-scale deployments.
