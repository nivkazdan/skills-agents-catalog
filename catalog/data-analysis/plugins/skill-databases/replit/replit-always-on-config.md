## Summary

This skill configures Replit's Always On feature for persistent application uptime. It covers enabling Always On for paid tier Repls, implementing proper health check endpoints, setting up external uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot, Pingdom), handling cold starts and warming strategies, configuring graceful shutdown behavior, monitoring uptime metrics and alerts, and troubleshooting when Always On fails to keep the Repl running. Essential for production services that need 24/7 availability.
