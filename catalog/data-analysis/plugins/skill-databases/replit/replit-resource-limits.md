## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Understand and optimize Replit resource limits including CPU, memory, storage, and egress quotas.
**Workflow:** Resource optimization skill - prevents throttling and ensures efficient platform usage.
**Relates to:** Informs replit-cost-optimization and replit-performance-tuning; prevents replit-common-errors.

## Summary

This skill covers understanding and working within Replit's resource limits. It explains the different tier limits (Free, Replit Core, Teams), monitoring current resource usage, optimizing memory usage through efficient coding patterns, reducing CPU consumption for long-running processes, managing storage within quota limits, understanding and reducing egress bandwidth usage, and upgrading strategies when limits are consistently reached. Proper resource management is essential for reliable applications.
