## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Implement reliability patterns including graceful degradation, health checks, and disaster recovery for Replit apps.
**Workflow:** Production resilience skill - ensures applications handle failures gracefully.
**Relates to:** Builds on replit-observability; complements replit-deployments for production.

## Summary

This skill implements reliability patterns for production Replit applications. It covers implementing comprehensive health check endpoints, graceful degradation when dependencies fail, retry logic with exponential backoff for external services, circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascade failures, graceful shutdown handling for deployments, disaster recovery and backup strategies, handling Replit platform outages, implementing fallback behaviors for degraded states, load testing to identify breaking points, and documenting runbooks for incident response. Reliability patterns ensure applications remain available during failures.
