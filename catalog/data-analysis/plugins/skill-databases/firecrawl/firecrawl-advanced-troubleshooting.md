## Summary

This skill provides advanced troubleshooting techniques for complex FireCrawl issues. It covers JavaScript rendering debugging (headless browser behavior, wait strategies, dynamic content), anti-bot detection analysis (fingerprinting, behavior patterns, proxy requirements), parsing failure investigation (malformed HTML, encoding issues, structure changes), network-level debugging (SSL issues, DNS problems, timeouts), and creating minimal reproductions for support escalation. These techniques resolve the hardest scraping challenges.
