## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Guides configuration of .cursorrules files for project-specific AI behavior including coding standards, framework patterns, and example code.

**Workflow:** This skill activates when developers want to customize AI behavior for their project. It covers file location, basic and advanced configuration, framework-specific templates (Next.js, Express, FastAPI), and verification techniques.

**Relates to:** cursor-debug-bundle (.cursorrules debugging), cursor-reference-architecture (architecture patterns), cursor-custom-prompts (prompt integration), cursor-tab-completion (completion behavior)

## Summary

This configuration skill provides comprehensive guidance for .cursorrules files. It covers file location (project root), basic configuration (project, language, framework, rules), advanced sections (context for architecture decisions, examples for code patterns, testing configuration), framework-specific templates for Next.js App Router, Express/Node.js, and Python FastAPI, tips for effective rules (be specific, include examples, reference files), and verification procedures.
