## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Creates effective custom prompts for Cursor AI including structured templates, domain-specific patterns, and .cursorrules integration for reusable prompt libraries.

**Workflow:** This skill activates when developers want to improve their prompt effectiveness or create reusable prompt templates. It covers prompt structure, templates, domain-specific prompts, advanced techniques, and best practices.

**Relates to:** cursor-ai-chat (using prompts in chat), cursor-rules-config (embedding prompts), cursor-context-management (efficient prompts), cursor-composer-workflows (Composer prompts)

## Summary

This optimization skill covers effective prompt engineering for Cursor. It includes prompt structure fundamentals (context, task, constraints, format, examples), templates for code generation, review, debugging, and refactoring, domain-specific prompts (API development, React components, database operations), advanced techniques (chain-of-thought, few-shot learning, role-based, constraint prompting), prompt library with quick actions and transformations, .cursorrules integration for embedded prompts and aliases, and best practices (do's and don'ts, iteration cycles).
