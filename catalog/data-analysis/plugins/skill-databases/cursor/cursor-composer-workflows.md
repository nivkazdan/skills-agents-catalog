## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Masters Cursor Composer for multi-file AI edits including creating files, editing across codebases, feature generation, and refactoring workflows.

**Workflow:** This skill activates when developers need to create or modify multiple files at once. It covers basic usage, workflow patterns (feature generation, incremental building, pattern replication), best practices, common use cases, and troubleshooting.

**Relates to:** cursor-advanced-composer (advanced techniques), cursor-context-management (context in Composer), cursor-rules-config (patterns for Composer), cursor-reference-architecture (architecture patterns)

## Summary

This workflow skill teaches effective use of Cursor's Composer feature for multi-file operations. It covers opening Composer (Cmd+I), creating multiple files at once, editing across the codebase, workflow patterns (feature generation, incremental building, pattern replication), best practices (clear specifications, review before apply, iterative workflow), common use cases (API development, component libraries, database operations, refactoring), and troubleshooting tips.
