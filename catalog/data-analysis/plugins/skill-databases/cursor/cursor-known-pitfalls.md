## Summary

This preventive skill documents common Cursor pitfalls with solutions. It covers AI feature pitfalls (over-trusting output, context pollution, vague prompts, wrong model), completion pitfalls (tab key confusion, outdated suggestions, language mismatch), configuration pitfalls (missing .cursorrules, poor .cursorignore, unsync settings), security pitfalls (exposing secrets, trusting AI for security code, API keys in settings), performance pitfalls (too many extensions, large context, indexing entire codebase), workflow pitfalls (not using history, ignoring Composer review, single-tool mindset), team pitfalls (no shared config, conflicting extensions, knowledge silos), and recovery strategies with prevention checklists.
