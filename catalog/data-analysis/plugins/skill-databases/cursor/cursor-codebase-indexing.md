## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Sets up and optimizes Cursor codebase indexing for semantic search and AI context, covering configuration, maintenance, and optimization strategies.

**Workflow:** This skill activates when setting up indexing for a new project or optimizing search performance. It covers what gets indexed, configuration, settings, using the index effectively, maintenance, and large project strategies.

**Relates to:** cursor-indexing-issues (troubleshooting), cursor-context-management (using indexed context), cursor-multi-repo (monorepo indexing), cursor-performance-tuning (indexing performance)

## Summary

This setup skill provides comprehensive guidance for Cursor's codebase indexing system. It covers what gets indexed (source code, configs, docs) and what doesn't (binaries, node_modules), enabling indexing, .cursorignore configuration (basic and advanced patterns), performance settings, using @codebase queries effectively (find definitions, understand architecture, find usage), maintenance procedures (manual reindex, auto-update), and optimization strategies for large projects and monorepos.
