## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Guides configuration and selection of AI models in Cursor for optimal balance of speed, quality, and cost across different task types.

**Workflow:** This skill activates when users need to choose or configure AI models. It covers built-in models, custom API key setup, task-based model selection, cost optimization, and troubleshooting model issues.

**Relates to:** cursor-api-key-management (custom API keys), cursor-tab-completion (completion models), cursor-ai-chat (chat models), cursor-usage-analytics (cost tracking)

## Summary

This configuration skill covers comprehensive AI model selection in Cursor. It compares available models (GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Claude Sonnet/Opus, Cursor-small) by speed, quality, and context size. The skill provides task-based recommendations (fast model for completions, powerful for architecture), custom API key configuration for OpenAI/Anthropic/Azure/Google, cost optimization strategies, and model-specific settings.
