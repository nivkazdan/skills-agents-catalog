## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Provides advanced Cursor Composer techniques for complex multi-file operations including orchestration, architecture migrations, and quality-controlled code generation.

**Workflow:** This skill activates when developers need to perform complex multi-file operations beyond basic Composer usage. It covers orchestration patterns, complex refactoring, advanced patterns, strategies, and quality control.

**Relates to:** cursor-composer-workflows (basic Composer), cursor-reference-architecture (architecture patterns), cursor-rules-config (patterns for Composer), cursor-context-management (context in large operations)

## Summary

This advanced skill extends Composer usage for complex operations. It covers multi-file orchestration (coordinated file creation for complete features), complex refactoring (pattern transformation, architecture migration, API version migration), advanced patterns (template application, code generation pipelines, cross-cutting concerns), Composer strategies (incremental refinement, reference-based generation, constraint-based generation), quality control (review workflow, verification prompts, testing generated code), and troubleshooting limitations with recovery strategies.
