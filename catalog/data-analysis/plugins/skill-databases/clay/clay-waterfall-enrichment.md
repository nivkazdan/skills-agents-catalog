## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Implement Clay waterfall enrichment patterns with multi-provider fallback and quality scoring. Maximizes enrichment coverage while optimizing costs.
**Workflow:** Data quality skill. Use when building comprehensive enrichment pipelines.
**Relates to:** Builds on clay-enrichment-patterns; integrates with clay-cost-tuning for optimization.

## Summary

This skill implements waterfall enrichment patterns with Clay. It covers configuring provider priority chains, implementing fallback logic when primary providers fail, building quality scoring systems to evaluate enrichment results, optimizing provider selection for cost vs. quality, handling partial enrichment results, and creating unified data models from multiple sources. Essential for maximizing data coverage.
