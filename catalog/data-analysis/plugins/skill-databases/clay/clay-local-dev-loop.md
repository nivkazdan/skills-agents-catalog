## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Configure Clay local development environment with testing workflows, mock data, and efficient iteration patterns. Enables rapid development without consuming API credits.
**Workflow:** Development environment setup skill. Execute after clay-install-auth when setting up a development workflow.
**Relates to:** Builds on clay-install-auth; enables efficient development for all other Clay skills.

## Summary

This skill establishes a fast local development cycle for Clay integrations. It covers setting up mock data for testing, configuring environment variables for development vs production, creating test fixtures that simulate Clay API responses, and implementing patterns that minimize API credit usage during development. Essential for teams building significant Clay integrations.
