## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Apply Clay advanced debugging techniques for hard-to-diagnose enrichment and integration issues. Covers complex failure modes and systematic debugging.
**Workflow:** Advanced troubleshooting skill. Use when standard troubleshooting fails.
**Relates to:** Escalation from clay-common-errors; uses clay-debug-bundle for evidence collection.

## Summary

This skill provides advanced debugging techniques for complex Clay issues. It covers systematic failure layer identification (network, auth, API, enrichment, integration), creating minimal reproductions, analyzing enrichment chain failures, debugging CRM sync issues, investigating intermittent failures, and preparing detailed escalations for Clay support. Essential for senior engineers handling complex issues.
