## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Set up comprehensive observability for Clay integrations with metrics, traces, and alerts. Provides complete visibility into enrichment operations.
**Workflow:** Monitoring skill. Use when establishing production monitoring for Clay.
**Relates to:** Integrates with clay-prod-checklist; supports clay-incident-runbook for incident response.

## Summary

This skill implements full observability for Clay integrations. It covers setting up metrics collection (enrichment counts, latency, error rates), implementing distributed tracing for API calls, configuring structured logging with correlation IDs, creating alerting rules for anomalies, building dashboards for operational visibility, and integrating with popular observability platforms (Datadog, New Relic, Grafana).
