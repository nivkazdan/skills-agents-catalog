### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Apply advanced debugging for hard-to-diagnose issues including race conditions, memory leaks, and intermittent failures.
**Workflow:** Used when standard troubleshooting fails and issues require deep investigation.
**Relates to:** Follows vercel-migration-deep-dive; extends vercel-debug-bundle with advanced techniques

## Summary

This skill covers advanced debugging techniques for complex Vercel issues. It includes comprehensive evidence collection with extended logs, metrics, network captures, and traces, systematic layer-by-layer isolation testing, minimal reproduction creation, timing analysis for performance issues, memory and resource profiling for leak detection, race condition detection patterns, and support escalation templates. The goal is successfully diagnosing 95% of escalated issues.
