## Summary

This skill provides a comprehensive checklist for deploying Vercel integrations to production. It covers pre-deployment configuration (API keys, webhooks, secrets), code quality verification (tests, error handling, rate limiting), infrastructure setup (health checks, monitoring, circuit breakers), and documentation requirements (runbooks, escalation paths). The gradual rollout section shows how to deploy with canary releases and instant rollback capability.
