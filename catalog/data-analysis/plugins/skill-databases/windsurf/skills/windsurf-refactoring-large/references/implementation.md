# Implementation Guide

1. **Analyze Scope**
   - Run Cascade analysis on target patterns
   - Map all affected files and dependencies
   - Identify high-risk areas and critical paths
   - Generate risk assessment report

2. **Create Plan**
   - Define phases based on dependency order
   - Set validation checkpoints between phases
   - Create rollback procedures for each phase
   - Document success criteria per phase

3. **Prepare Environment**
   - Add tests for untested code paths
   - Create pre-refactor snapshot
   - Verify rollback process works
   - Coordinate with team on freeze periods

4. **Execute with Cascade**
   - Apply changes incrementally by phase
   - Validate at each checkpoint
   - Track progress in phase files
   - Pause and review at milestones

5. **Verify Completion**
   - Run complete test suite
   - Compare performance metrics to baseline
   - Update documentation for changed APIs
   - Archive refactoring artifacts
