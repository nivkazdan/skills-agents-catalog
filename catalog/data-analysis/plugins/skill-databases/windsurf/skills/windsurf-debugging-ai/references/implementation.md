# Implementation Guide

1. **Capture Error Context**
   - Reproduce the error
   - Capture stack trace and logs
   - Note environmental conditions

2. **Analyze with Cascade**
   - Share error message with Cascade
   - Provide relevant code context
   - Review AI analysis

3. **Investigate Root Cause**
   - Set breakpoints at suggested locations
   - Inspect variable states
   - Trace execution flow

4. **Apply Fix**
   - Implement Cascade-suggested fix
   - Test fix thoroughly
   - Verify error is resolved

5. **Document for Prevention**
   - Add to error patterns if new
   - Update tests to catch regression
   - Share learnings with team
