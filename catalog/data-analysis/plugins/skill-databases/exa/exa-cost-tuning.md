## Summary

This skill optimizes Exa costs: understanding pricing model (requests, content extraction), minimizing numResults to actual needs, selective content extraction (text vs highlights vs full), caching to reduce duplicate requests, usage tracking and reporting, budget alerts and spending limits, tier optimization based on usage patterns, and batch request optimization. Target: 40% cost reduction through intelligent usage patterns.
