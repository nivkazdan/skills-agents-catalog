## Summary

This skill sets up a complete local development environment for Vercel projects. It covers project structure, environment management with .env files, hot reload configuration with tsx, and test suite setup with Vitest. The goal is to achieve a fast iteration cycle where developers can make changes and see results immediately without manual restarts or redeployments.
