## Summary

This skill addresses cost optimization for Vercel usage. It covers pricing tier comparison (Hobby, Pro, Enterprise), cost estimation functions based on request volume, usage monitoring classes for tracking against budgets, cost reduction strategies (sampling for telemetry, request batching, caching, compression), budget alert configuration, and SQL queries for cost dashboards. The goal is to reduce Vercel costs by 30% or more through optimization.
