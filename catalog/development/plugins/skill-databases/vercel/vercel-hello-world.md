**Relates to:** Depends on vercel-install-auth; leads to vercel-local-dev-loop for development workflow setup

## Summary

This skill provides a minimal working example of Vercel integration. After completing authentication setup, developers use this skill to make their first API call, verify the connection works, and understand the basic patterns for interacting with Vercel APIs. It serves as both a validation step and a learning exercise for new Vercel developers.
