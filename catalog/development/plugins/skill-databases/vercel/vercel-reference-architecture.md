## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Implement production-ready reference architecture with layered structure, client wrapper, error boundary, and health checks.
**Workflow:** Used when starting new Vercel projects or refactoring existing ones to follow best practices.
**Relates to:** Synthesizes all CI/CD skills; flagship leads to vercel-multi-env-setup

## Summary

This skill provides a complete reference architecture for Vercel integrations. It defines the project structure with separation of concerns (vercel/, services/, api/, jobs/ directories), layer architecture (API, Service, Vercel, Infrastructure), client wrapper with caching and monitoring, error boundary patterns, health check implementation, data flow diagrams, and configuration management. This architecture serves as the blueprint for all production Vercel projects.
