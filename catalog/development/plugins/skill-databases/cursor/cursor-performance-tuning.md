## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Optimizes Cursor IDE performance including editor settings, extension management, AI features, indexing, and system resource management.

**Workflow:** This skill activates when Cursor is slow or using excessive resources. It covers diagnostics, editor optimization, extension optimization, AI feature optimization, indexing optimization, system resource management, and maintenance schedules.

**Relates to:** cursor-common-errors (performance issues), cursor-extension-integration (extension overhead), cursor-indexing-issues (indexing performance), cursor-codebase-indexing (indexing setup)

## Summary

This optimization skill covers comprehensive performance tuning for Cursor. It includes diagnostics (Process Explorer, Developer Tools, Startup Performance), editor optimization (visual overhead reduction, file handling, search exclusions), extension optimization (audit, workspace-specific, load optimization), AI feature optimization (completion speed, context management, model selection), indexing optimization (aggressive exclusions, settings), system resource management (memory, CPU, disk I/O), large project strategies (monorepo, remote development), performance checklists (daily, weekly, monthly), and troubleshooting (won't start, extreme slowness, memory leaks).
