**Relates to:** cursor-install-auth (initial extension setup), cursor-performance-tuning (extension performance), cursor-upgrade-migration (extension migration), cursor-keybindings (extension keybindings)

## Summary

This integration skill covers comprehensive VS Code extension management in Cursor. It includes compatibility information (what works, what conflicts with AI features), installation methods (marketplace, command line, VSIX), essential extensions by category (code quality, language support, framework tools, git), recommended configurations (extensions.json, per-extension settings), managing conflicts (AI assistants, completion providers, keybindings), extension development with Cursor AI, performance optimization (reducing overhead, workspace-specific), syncing extensions across machines, and troubleshooting.
