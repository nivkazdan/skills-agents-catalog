## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Establishes an optimal daily development workflow using Cursor, covering morning startup routines, feature development cycles, and efficient keyboard-driven patterns.

**Workflow:** This skill activates when developers want to optimize their productivity with Cursor. It provides structured workflows for morning startup, feature development (define, scaffold, implement, debug, refactor), context management, git integration, and testing patterns.

**Relates to:** cursor-keybindings (keyboard shortcuts), cursor-context-management (context optimization), cursor-git-integration (version control), cursor-composer-workflows (multi-file edits)

## Summary

This productivity-focused skill establishes a structured development workflow optimized for Cursor's AI features. It covers keyboard-driven navigation, the feature development cycle (Chat for planning, Composer for scaffolding, Tab for implementation, Chat for debugging, Inline Edit for refinement), git integration for pre-commit reviews and conflict resolution, and testing patterns including TDD with AI assistance.
