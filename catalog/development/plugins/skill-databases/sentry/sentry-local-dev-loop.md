**Purpose:** Set up local development workflow with Sentry including debug mode, environment-based configuration, and development-specific settings.
**Workflow:** Configure after initial setup to optimize the development experience. Enables debug logging, separate DSNs, and appropriate sample rates for development.
**Relates to:** Follows `sentry-hello-world` verification. Leads into `sentry-sdk-patterns` for best practices.

## Summary

This skill configures Sentry for efficient local development with appropriate settings that differ from production. It covers environment-based configuration, debug mode enablement, development-only DSNs, and testing scripts. Use this skill to set up a development workflow that captures errors locally without polluting production data or exceeding quotas.
