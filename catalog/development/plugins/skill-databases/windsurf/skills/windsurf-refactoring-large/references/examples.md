# Examples

**Example: API Version Migration**
Request: "Migrate all API v1 calls to v2 across the codebase"
Result: Phased migration with compatibility layer, gradual cutover, and v1 deprecation

**Example: Framework Upgrade**
Request: "Upgrade React class components to functional components with hooks"
Result: Systematic conversion with state migration, lifecycle method translation, and test updates

**Example: Architecture Restructure**
Request: "Move from monolithic services to domain-driven modules"
Result: Code reorganization with dependency injection, interface extraction, and module boundaries
