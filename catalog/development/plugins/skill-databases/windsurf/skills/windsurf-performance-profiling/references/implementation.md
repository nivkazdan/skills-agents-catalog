# Implementation Guide

1. **Establish Baseline**
   - Run profiler on current application
   - Document baseline metrics
   - Set performance thresholds

2. **Collect Profile Data**
   - Enable profiling for target scenarios
   - Capture representative workloads
   - Export profile data

3. **Analyze with Cascade**
   - Upload profile to Cascade
   - Identify hot paths and bottlenecks
   - Generate optimization recommendations

4. **Implement Optimizations**
   - Prioritize by impact and effort
   - Apply targeted fixes
   - Re-profile to measure improvement

5. **Document and Monitor**
   - Record before/after metrics
   - Update benchmarks
   - Set up continuous monitoring
