## Summary

This skill configures Replit's multiplayer collaboration features. It covers inviting collaborators to join a Repl session, using real-time cursors to see where teammates are editing, enabling voice and video chat within the IDE, collaborating on the same file simultaneously, managing editing conflicts and merge scenarios, using chat and comments for async communication, screen sharing for demonstrations and debugging, setting permissions for view-only vs edit access, and best practices for effective pair programming. Multiplayer makes remote collaboration feel like sitting together.
