**Purpose:** Perform security audit of Replit projects including secrets scanning, dependency audit, and access review.
**Workflow:** Security assessment skill - identifies vulnerabilities before they become incidents.
**Relates to:** Validates replit-secrets-management; informs replit-team-management access controls.

## Summary

This skill performs security audits on Replit projects. It covers scanning code for hardcoded secrets and credentials, auditing npm/pip dependencies for known vulnerabilities, reviewing Secrets configuration for proper access controls, checking for exposed sensitive files (.env, config files), validating HTTPS and secure communication patterns, auditing team member access and permissions, reviewing deployment security configurations, identifying insecure coding patterns (SQL injection, XSS), and generating security audit reports with remediation priorities. Regular security audits prevent breaches.
