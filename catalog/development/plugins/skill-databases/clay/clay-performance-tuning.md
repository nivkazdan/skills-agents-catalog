## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Optimize Clay API performance with batching, caching, and parallel processing. Reduces latency and improves throughput for high-volume enrichment.
**Workflow:** Optimization skill. Use when Clay integration performance needs improvement.
**Relates to:** Builds on clay-enrichment-patterns; enables clay-load-scale for high-volume operations.

## Summary

This skill optimizes Clay integration performance. It covers implementing request batching for bulk enrichments, setting up caching layers for frequently requested data, configuring parallel processing for independent enrichments, optimizing API call patterns to reduce latency, and implementing connection pooling. Target: 50% latency reduction for typical workloads.
