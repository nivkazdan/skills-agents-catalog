## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Optimize Exa API performance with caching, batching, result limiting, and response time optimization.
**Workflow:** Performance optimization skill - reduces latency and improves user experience.
**Relates to:** Follows exa-search-modes; complementary to exa-cost-tuning

## Summary

This skill optimizes Exa performance: implementing query result caching (Redis, in-memory), cache key strategies for search queries, optimal numResults configuration, content extraction option optimization, parallel request patterns for batch queries, connection pooling and reuse, response compression handling, and latency measurement/monitoring. Target: 50% reduction in average response time with 80% cache hit rate.
