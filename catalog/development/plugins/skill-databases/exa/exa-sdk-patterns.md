## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Apply production-ready Exa SDK patterns including client singleton, error handling, retry logic, and type-safe wrappers.
**Workflow:** Graduate skill from basic usage to production-quality code patterns.
**Relates to:** Follows exa-hello-world; provides foundation for exa-reference-architecture

## Summary

This skill covers production-grade Exa SDK patterns including: singleton client initialization, comprehensive error handling with specific error types, automatic retry with exponential backoff and jitter, request/response logging, type-safe TypeScript/Python wrappers, and configuration management. These patterns prevent common production issues and establish maintainable, reliable Exa integrations.
