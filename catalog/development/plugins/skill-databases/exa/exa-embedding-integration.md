## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Integrate Exa neural embeddings with vector databases for custom similarity search, clustering, and advanced ML workflows.
**Workflow:** Advanced ML skill - extends Exa capabilities with vector infrastructure.
**Relates to:** Follows exa-similarity-search; complements exa-rag-integration

## Summary

This skill integrates Exa with vector databases: extracting neural embeddings from Exa results, storing embeddings in Pinecone/Weaviate/Qdrant/Chroma, building custom similarity indices, clustering content by semantic similarity, hybrid search (Exa + vector DB), embedding caching strategies, incremental index updates, and cross-collection similarity search. Target: Sub-100ms similarity search across 1M+ vectors with Exa-quality embeddings.
