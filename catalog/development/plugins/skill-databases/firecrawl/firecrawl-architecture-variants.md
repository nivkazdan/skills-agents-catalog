## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Choose and implement validated architecture blueprints for single-site, multi-site, or enterprise-scale scraping operations.
**Workflow:** Architecture decision skill - matches scraping architecture to project requirements and scale.
**Relates to:** Extends firecrawl-reference-architecture; synthesis of all advanced patterns

## Summary

This skill provides architecture blueprints for different scraping scales and requirements. It covers single-site architecture (simple, focused extraction), multi-site architecture (diverse sources, unified processing), enterprise architecture (governance, multi-team, high volume), serverless architecture (cost-optimized, event-driven), and hybrid architecture (combining patterns). Each blueprint includes decision criteria, implementation guides, scaling paths, and cost considerations.
