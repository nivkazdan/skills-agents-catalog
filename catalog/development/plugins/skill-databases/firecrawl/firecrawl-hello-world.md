## Summary

This skill creates a minimal "hello world" example for FireCrawl that demonstrates the core workflow: scraping a URL and converting it to clean, LLM-ready markdown. It shows developers the fundamental API pattern of initializing the client, calling the scrape method, and receiving structured markdown output. This is the quickest path to seeing FireCrawl's value in action.
