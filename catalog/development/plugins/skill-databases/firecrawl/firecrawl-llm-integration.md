## File Descriptions

### 1. SKILL.md
**Purpose:** Integrate FireCrawl output with LLMs for RAG pipelines, content analysis, and structured data extraction.
**Workflow:** AI integration skill - connects FireCrawl's LLM-ready output to downstream AI/ML pipelines.
**Relates to:** Core differentiator skill - FireCrawl's primary value is LLM-ready output; enables firecrawl-architecture-variants

## Summary

This skill integrates FireCrawl with LLM-based applications. It covers markdown chunking strategies for context windows, embedding generation for vector databases, structured data extraction using LLM parsing, RAG pipeline integration (LangChain, LlamaIndex), content summarization and analysis, and prompt engineering for scraped content. This enables powerful AI-driven applications built on web data extracted through FireCrawl.
