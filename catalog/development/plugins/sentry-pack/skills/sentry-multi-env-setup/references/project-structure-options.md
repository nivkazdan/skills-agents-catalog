# Project Structure Options

## Project Structure Options

### Option 1: Single Project, Multiple Environments
```
Organization: mycompany
└── Project: myapp
    ├── Environment: development
    ├── Environment: staging
    └── Environment: production
```

**Pros:** Unified view, easier correlation
**Cons:** Noisy in development, shared quotas

### Option 2: Separate Projects Per Environment
```
Organization: mycompany
├── Project: myapp-development
├── Project: myapp-staging
└── Project: myapp-production
```

**Pros:** Clean separation, independent quotas
**Cons:** Multiple DSNs to manage

### Option 3: Hybrid (Recommended)
```
Organization: mycompany
├── Project: myapp-production    # Production only
└── Project: myapp-nonprod       # Dev + Staging
```
