# Error Handling Reference

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Dev errors in prod dashboard` | Shared DSN | Use separate DSN per environment or disable in dev |
| `Environment filter not working` | Environment not set | Verify `environment` option in SDK init |
| `Staging alerts overwhelming` | Same alert rules as prod | Configure environment-specific alert conditions |
| `Sample rates inconsistent` | Hard-coded values | Use environment-based configuration object |
