# Sample dataset for AutoML pipeline builder plugin
# This dataset is a simplified example and may not be suitable for all AutoML tasks.
# Replace this with your actual dataset for optimal results.
#
# Columns:
#   feature1: Numerical feature (e.g., age, income)
#   feature2: Categorical feature (e.g., city, product type) - encoded as strings
#   target: Target variable (e.g., churn, conversion) - binary (0 or 1)

# Add more data rows here.  Aim for a larger dataset (hundreds or thousands of rows) for better AutoML performance.
# Example:
# 52,Miami,0
# 39,Boston,1
# Consider adding missing values (e.g., empty strings) to test the pipeline's handling of missing data.
# For categorical features with many unique values, consider using techniques like one-hot encoding or target encoding.
