## Using the Index

### @codebase Queries
```
Find definitions:
"@codebase where is the User class defined?"
"@codebase find all authentication-related functions"

Understand architecture:
"@codebase how is the database connection handled?"
"@codebase what are the main API routes?"

Find usage:
"@codebase where is handleLogin called?"
"@codebase show examples of using the cache"
```

### Effective Search Patterns
```
Specific:
"@codebase find the validateEmail function"
"@codebase show ProductService class methods"

Semantic:
"@codebase how do we handle authentication?"
"@codebase what's the error handling pattern?"

Exploratory:
"@codebase summarize the main modules"
"@codebase list all API endpoints"
```
