# Error Handling Reference

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Composer not finding files | Wrong path or file excluded | Use explicit paths with @-mentions |
| Changes not as expected | Prompt too vague | Be more specific, provide examples |
| Composer timeout | Request too large | Break into smaller requests |
| Conflicting edits | Multiple files with dependencies | Apply changes sequentially, review carefully |
