# Quality Control

## Quality Control

### Review Workflow
```
1. Generate with Composer
2. Review each file before accepting
3. Check for:
   - Type safety
   - Error handling
   - Security issues
   - Performance
   - Test coverage
4. Request refinements if needed
5. Apply when satisfied
```

### Verification Prompts
```
After generation:
"Review the generated code for:
- Missing error handling
- Type safety issues
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance problems
- Missing edge cases"
```

### Testing Generated Code
```
"Add tests for all generated code:
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for API routes
- Component tests for React components
- E2E tests for critical paths"
```
