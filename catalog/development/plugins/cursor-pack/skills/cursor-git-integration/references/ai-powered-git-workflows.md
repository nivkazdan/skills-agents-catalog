### Code Review Assistance
```
Review changes before commit:
"@git diff HEAD Review these changes for issues"

Review specific commit:
"@git show abc123 Explain what this commit does"

Review branch:
"@git diff main..feature/auth Review all changes in this branch"
```

### Conflict Resolution
```
When conflicts occur:
1. Open conflicting file
2. See conflict markers:
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   your code
   =======
   their code
   >>>>>>> branch

3. Use AI to resolve:
   Select conflict → Cmd+L →
   "Resolve this conflict, keeping the new auth logic"

4. Or use inline edit:
   Cmd+K → "Merge keeping both implementations"
```
