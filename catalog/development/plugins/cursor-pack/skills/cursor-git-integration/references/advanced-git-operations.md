# Advanced Git Operations

## Advanced Git Operations

### Interactive Rebase Help
```
Ask AI for guidance:
"I need to squash the last 5 commits. Walk me through:
1. The git commands
2. How to write a good combined message
3. How to handle force push safely"
```

### Cherry-Pick Guidance
```
"@git log Show recent commits on feature/payments"
"Help me cherry-pick commit abc123 to main:
- What's the command?
- How do I handle conflicts?
- Should I use -x flag?"
```

### Stash Operations
```
Stash with AI:
"I need to switch branches but have uncommitted changes.
Help me stash properly and restore later."

Commands:
git stash push -m "work in progress on auth"
git stash list
git stash pop
```
