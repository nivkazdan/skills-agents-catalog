# Team Workflows

## Team Workflows

### Code Review with Cursor
```
Team workflow:
1. Developer creates PR
2. Reviewer opens in Cursor
3. Uses @git diff for AI review
4. Comments with AI suggestions
5. Developer addresses feedback

AI-assisted review:
"@git diff main..feature/auth
Review this PR for:
- Security issues
- Performance concerns
- Code style violations
- Missing tests"
```

### Pair Programming
```
With Cursor, less need for real-time pairing:

Async collaboration:
1. Developer writes initial code
2. Uses Composer for scaffolding
3. Commits with clear messages
4. Reviewer uses AI to understand
5. AI-assisted feedback

When to still pair:
- Complex architecture decisions
- Knowledge transfer
- Onboarding new members
