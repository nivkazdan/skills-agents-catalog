# Team Key Management

## Team Key Management

### Shared Keys (Not Recommended)
```
Issues with shared keys:
- No individual tracking
- Security risk
- Hard to rotate
- Compliance problems
```

### Per-User Keys
```
Best practice:
1. Each developer has own key
2. Keys tied to individual accounts
3. Usage tracked per person
4. Easy rotation
```

### Enterprise Setup
```
Options:
1. Azure OpenAI (enterprise)
   - Central management
   - Azure AD auth
   - RBAC controls

2. API Gateway
   - Centralized key management
   - Usage tracking
   - Rate limiting

3. Secrets Manager
   - HashiCorp Vault
   - AWS Secrets Manager
   - Azure Key Vault
