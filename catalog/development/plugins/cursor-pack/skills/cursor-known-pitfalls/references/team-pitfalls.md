# Team Pitfalls

## Team Pitfalls

### No Shared Configuration
```
PITFALL:
Everyone has different .cursorrules.
Inconsistent AI-generated code.

SOLUTION:
- Commit .cursorrules to repo
- Document team standards
- Review rules in PRs
- Onboard new members
```

### Conflicting Extensions
```
PITFALL:
Team members with different extensions.
Code formatted differently.

SOLUTION:
- .vscode/extensions.json in repo
- Shared formatter config
- Enforce in CI
- Document required extensions
```

### Knowledge Silos
```
PITFALL:
Best prompts/techniques not shared.
Duplicate effort discovering patterns.

SOLUTION:
- Share effective prompts
- Document in .cursorrules
- Team prompt library
- Regular knowledge sharing
