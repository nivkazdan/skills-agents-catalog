  "reasoning": "Based on historical CPU and memory utilization, the instance is consistently underutilized. Resizing to a t3.medium instance will provide sufficient resources while reducing costs.",

  "implementationSteps": [
    "1. Stop the EC2 instance.",
    "2. Change the instance type to t3.medium in the AWS console or using the AWS CLI.",
    "3. Start the EC2 instance.",
    "4. Monitor performance for 24-48 hours to ensure stability."
