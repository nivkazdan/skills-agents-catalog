# Example CSV data for clustering algorithm testing.
#
# This file demonstrates the expected format for input data to the clustering algorithms.
# Each row represents a data point, and each column represents a feature.
#
# Replace the placeholder data below with your own dataset.
# You can add or remove columns as needed, but ensure the column headers are descriptive.
#
# Note: The first row MUST be the header row containing column names.
#
# Example usage:
# 1. Save this file as 'example_data.csv' or a similar descriptive name.
# 2. Run the clustering algorithm using the command: /run-clustering
#    (The plugin will prompt you for the data file name if it isn't the default).
