Clustering Visualization Notebook

This notebook demonstrates how to visualize clustering results using matplotlib and seaborn.

It assumes that you have already run a clustering algorithm and have cluster assignments for your data.

Instructions:
1.  Replace the placeholder data loading and clustering results with your actual data.
2.  Adjust the visualization parameters (e.g., colors, markers) to suit your data and preferences.
3.  Experiment with different visualization techniques to gain insights into your clustering results.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np  # Import numpy

# --- Placeholder: Load your data here ---
# Replace this with your actual data loading code
# For example:
# data = pd.read_csv("your_data.csv")
# features = data[["feature1", "feature2"]] # Select the features used for clustering

# Generate some sample data if no data is loaded
np.random.seed(42)  # for reproducibility
num_samples = 100
features = pd.DataFrame({
    'feature1': np.random.rand(num_samples),
    'feature2': np.random.rand(num_samples)
})

# --- Placeholder: Load your clustering results here ---
# Replace this with your actual cluster assignments
# For example:
# cluster_labels = model.labels_  # Assuming you used scikit-learn
# Or:
# cluster_labels = your_clustering_function(features)

# Generate some sample cluster labels if no cluster labels are loaded
num_clusters = 3
cluster_labels = np.random.randint(0, num_clusters, num_samples)


# --- Create a DataFrame for visualization ---
df = features.copy()
df['cluster'] = cluster_labels

# --- Visualization using matplotlib ---
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.title("Clustering Visualization (Matplotlib)")

# Define colors for each cluster
colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'purple', 'orange'] # Add more colors if needed

for cluster_id in df['cluster'].unique():
    cluster_data = df[df['cluster'] == cluster_id]
    plt.scatter(cluster_data['feature1'], cluster_data['feature2'],
                color=colors[cluster_id % len(colors)],  # Cycle through colors
                label=f'Cluster {cluster_id}')

plt.xlabel("Feature 1")
plt.ylabel("Feature 2")
plt.legend()
plt.show()


# --- Visualization using seaborn ---
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.title("Clustering Visualization (Seaborn)")
sns.scatterplot(x='feature1', y='feature2', hue='cluster', data=df, palette='viridis') # or other palettes
plt.show()

# --- Additional Visualizations ---
# You can add more visualizations here, such as:
# - Pair plots
# - Box plots
# - Histograms

# Example: Pair plot
# sns.pairplot(df, hue='cluster')
# plt.show()

# --- Summary and Interpretation ---
# Add your interpretation of the clustering results here.
# For example:
# "The clustering algorithm has successfully separated the data into distinct groups based on feature1 and feature2."
# "Cluster 0 represents the group with low values for both feature1 and feature2."
# "Cluster 1 represents the group with high values for feature1 and low values for feature2."
# "Cluster 2 represents the group with high values for both feature1 and feature2."

# --- Next Steps ---
# Consider the following next steps:
# - Evaluate the clustering performance using metrics like silhouette score or Davies-Bouldin index.
# - Tune the clustering algorithm parameters to improve the results.
# - Investigate the characteristics of each cluster to gain insights into the data.
# - Use the clustering results for downstream tasks, such as customer segmentation or anomaly detection.
